How to do IPM?
    Iteration planning meetings, which are frequently linked to Scrum and Agile techniques, are an essential step in the software development process that try to specify the goals and scope of a particular iteration or sprint. To decide which tasks and user stories will be addressed in the following iteration, the development team, product owner, and scrum master collaborate during this meeting.

1. Preparation
    Iteration planning is a process that takes place at the beginning of a sprint or iteration in agile software development frameworks and methodologies like Scrum or Kanban. The following team members are in alignment with this task: 
    This individual, a scrum master or team agility coach, facilitates meetings. 
    Product Owner: The product owner is in charge of the backlog details and approves the acceptance criteria. 
    Development Team: This team commits to completing the iteration's goals, defines and assigns the tasks for each iteration, and assesses the level of work required for each task. 
    Stakeholders, subject matter specialists, and other agile team representatives are optional planning participants who provide pertinent information.

2. Begin the meeting by:

    The scrum master introduces everyone and reiterates the meeting's objectives and agenda.
    Product Owner: Offers a high-level overview of the project's objectives and the iteration's specific goals. answers any queries the group may have regarding the user stories.

3. Select Backlog Items

    Development Team: Based on their capacity and velocity (previous performance), the team selects the backlog items they think they can finish within the iteration. The team decides on this option as a whole.

    Priority: Items with a higher priority are frequently picked first since they add the most value to the final product.

4. Break Down User Stories
    Development Team: For each selected user story, the team breaks it down into smaller, actionable tasks. This split aids in determining effort and monitoring advancement.
    Task Definition: Tasks should be well-defined, achievable within a day or two, and have clear acceptance criteria.
5. Estimate Effort
    Using measures like story points, ideal days, or hours, estimate the time needed for each activity, development team. This estimation aids in the planning and progress monitoring of the iteration.
6. Making capacity plans

    Development Team: Take into account the iteration's capability for the team. This includes taking into consideration any team members who could be out of the office for the duration of the iteration owing to vacations or other commitments.
7. Establish the Iteration Backlog:

    Development Team: Transfer the user stories or committed work from the iteration backlog to the product backlog. This specifies the tasks to be completed throughout the iteration.
Scrum Master: Summarizes the committed work and the goals of the iteration. Reinforces the importance of the team's commitment to the chosen tasks.
